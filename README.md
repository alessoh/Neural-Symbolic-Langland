# NEXUS-Langlands: Neural-Symbolic Architecture for Mathematical Analysis

A neural-symbolic transformer architecture for analyzing mathematical structures related to the Langlands Program, combining deep learning with symbolic reasoning.

## Overview

The Langlands NEXUS architecture provides a powerful framework for analyzing mathematical structures and relationships in the context of the Langlands Program. By combining neural networks' pattern recognition capabilities with symbolic mathematical reasoning, this architecture can:

1. Classify mathematical structures (Galois Groups, Automorphic Forms, L-Functions, etc.)
2. Reason about mathematical properties and their relationships
3. Apply mathematical rules and theorems to derive new knowledge
4. Provide transparent explanations of its reasoning process
5. Dynamically choose between neural, symbolic, or hybrid strategies based on confidence

This implementation is inspired by the NEXUS architecture for medicine and adapted for mathematical analysis in the context of the Langlands Program.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Neural Component

The neural component uses a transformer-based architecture with knowledge-aware attention mechanisms:

- **Knowledge-Aware Transformer**: Extends standard transformers by incorporating mathematical knowledge into the attention mechanisms
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Allows the model to attend to different mathematical properties
- **Symbolic Constraint Layers**: Apply constraints derived from mathematical knowledge

### 2. Symbolic Component

The symbolic component represents mathematical knowledge in a structured format:

- **Mathematical Knowledge Graph**: Represents mathematical entities, their properties, and relationships
- **Logical Reasoning Engine**: Applies mathematical rules and theorems
- **Proof Steps Tracking**: Maintains explicit reasoning chains

### 3. Neural-Symbolic Interface

The interface facilitates bidirectional information flow between neural and symbolic components:

- **Neural-to-Symbolic Translation**: Maps neural representations to mathematical concepts
- **Symbolic-to-Neural Translation**: Incorporates symbolic knowledge into neural processing
- **Mathematical Property Detection**: Identifies mathematical properties from neural representations

### 4. Metacognitive Control

The metacognitive controller dynamically determines which strategy to use:

- **Confidence Assessment**: Evaluates confidence of neural and symbolic components
- **Problem Type Characterization**: Adjusts strategy based on mathematical problem types
- **Strategy Selection**: Chooses between neural, symbolic, or hybrid approaches
- **Learning from Experience**: Updates strategy selection based on past performance

The Langlands Program establishes deep connections between number theory, representation theory, and harmonic analysis. Key mathematical structures included in this implementation:

1. **Galois Groups**: Groups of automorphisms of field extensions
2. **Automorphic Forms**: Generalizations of modular forms to higher dimensions
3. **L-Functions**: Complex analytic functions with functional equations and Euler products
4. **Shimura Varieties**: Generalizations of modular curves to higher dimensions
5. **Moduli Spaces**: Parameter spaces for mathematical objects
6. **Arithmetic Manifolds**: Manifolds with arithmetic significance

## Mathematical Properties

The model analyzes mathematical objects based on 30 key properties organized into three categories:

### Number Theory Properties
- algebraic_extension, prime_field, local_field, global_field, finite_field

### Group Representation Properties
- galois_representation, automorphic_representation, reductive_group

1. Add new mathematical properties to `feature_names` in `LanglandsMathDataset`
2. Add new mathematical structures to `class_names`
3. Update class patterns with appropriate property associations
4. Add new relationships, rules, and theorems to the knowledge graph in `init_langlands_knowledge_graph`
